## Talks
Inside Clojure with Brian Beckman and Rich Hickey — Overview of Clojure.

Clojure, Concurrency and You — Overview of Clojure concurrency primitives. Good watch after finishing Clojure By Example.

Simple Made Easy by Rich Hickey — Iconic talk that explains important design decisions around Clojure and the problems it aims to solve.

The Value of Values by Rich Hickey — Explains the importance of immutability and why it’s a key part of Clojure.

Persistent Data Structures and Managed References by Rich Hickey — Explains Clojure’s approach to managing state, and concurrent access to state.

Debugging with the Scientific Method by Stuart Halloway — Excellent talk on debugging Clojure code, and debugging in general.  

I would advise watching all of these, particularly the ones by Rich Hickey.

## Workshops / guided tutorials
Clojure by Example  — Exercises to learn Clojure from the basics. Not completely comprehensive but a great place to start. Maintained by the IN/Clojure team.

https://source.golabs.io/clojure-learning/clojure-by-example —  Edited version of the above exercises which was presented to the customer platforms team. Has a few additional exercises, but is not updated.

https://source.golabs.io/clojure-learning/srihari-daily-lessons/ — Another similar workshop with recorded sessions. Contains links to some other resources.

https://github.com/inclojure-org/intermediate-clojure-workshop - Connect to preview  — illustrates usage of more advanced concepts in Clojure, including core.async and Java interop.


## Books
The Joy of Clojure is probably the most comprehensive Clojure book out there.

Clojure for the Brave and True is free to read online. The writing style is not for everyone though. Chapter 7 and 8 are good for learning macros. Don't use the provided emacs config; it is many years out of date.

Professional Clojure

Elements of Clojure — Excellent book that offers insight into building maintainable Clojure applications through the use of good abstractions. Recommended read after you have some Clojure knowledge under your belt.
